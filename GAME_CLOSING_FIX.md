# 🎮 Game Closing Fix - Complete! 🎮

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Problem**: After games ended (win or lose), the entire pet system was closing instead of just the game window.

**Solution**: Fixed the game closing logic to properly separate game window closing from pet system shutdown.

## 🔧 **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Safe Game Manager Closing**
- **New method**: `close_current_game_safely()` in GameManager
- **Behavior**: Hides game windows instead of force-closing them
- **Result**: Pet continues running after games end

### **2. Proper Game Window Close Events**
- **Added `closeEvent()` handlers** to all game classes
- **Isolated closing**: Only the game window closes, not the entire pet
- **Clean shutdown**: CV workers and timers properly stopped

### **3. Enhanced CV Worker Management**
- **Safe stopping**: CV camera threads properly terminated
- **Resource cleanup**: Camera resources freed when games end
- **No lingering processes**: All threads cleaned up properly

### **4. Base Game Framework**
- **Default close behavior**: All games inherit safe closing
- **Consistent behavior**: Every game closes the same way
- **Debugging output**: Clear messages show what's closing

## 🎯 **NEW BEHAVIOR**

### **Before Fix:**
❌ Game ends → Entire pet system closes → User has to restart everything

### **After Fix:**
✅ Game ends → Only game window closes → Pet continues running → New games can be requested

## 🎮 **TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**

1. **Start the pet**: `python desktop_pet.py`
2. **Trigger a game**: Press I/O/G or wait for automatic request
3. **Play the game**: Win or lose doesn't matter
4. **Observe**: Game window closes, but pet stays on desktop
5. **Continue**: Pet immediately available for new game requests
