# 🎮 Desktop Pet with CV Game System - COMPLETE! 🎮

## ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED FEATURES**

### **🎯 Game System Integration**
- **Two fully functional games** integrated into the pet system:
  1. **Matcha Whisking Game** - Mouse-based whisking action game
  2. **Hand Alternator Game** - Computer vision hand tracking game

### **🎮 Game Mechanics** 
- **Ultra-frequent requests**: Games pop up every 10-15 seconds
- **Manual triggers**: Press I, O, G for game requests or P for instant launch
- **Punishment system**: Losing games triggers escalating chaos (window closing, cursor hijacking)
- **Reward system**: Winning games calms the pet and reduces annoyance
- **Persistent pet**: NEVER closes regardless of game outcomes

### **📷 Computer Vision Features**
- **Smart camera detection**: Tests multiple camera indices and backends
- **Dual operation modes**:
  - **Advanced mode**: MediaPipe hand tracking (if available)
  - **Motion detection mode**: OpenCV-only fallback for basic functionality
- **Runtime camera retry**: Users can reconnect camera during gameplay
- **Graceful degradation**: Works even without camera in simulation mode

### **⌨️ Controls**
- **I/O/G keys**: Manual game requests (bypasses cooldowns)
- **P key**: Instant game launch (no prompts)
- **Y key**: Accept game requests
- **N key**: Deny game requests
- **H key**: Show help/shortcuts
